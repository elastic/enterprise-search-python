== Overview

`enterprise-search-python` is the official Python client for Elastic
Enterprise Search, App Search, and Workplace Search.

=== Compatibility

Current development happens in the `master` branch.

The library is compatible with all Elastic Enterprise Search versions since `7.x`
but you **have to use a matching major version**:

For **Elastic Enterprise Search 7.0** and later, use the major version 7 (`7.x.y`) of the
library.

The recommended way to set your requirements in your `setup.py` or
`requirements.txt` is::

    # Elastic Enterprise Search 7.x
    elastic-enterprise-search>=7,<8

[discrete]
=== Example usage

[source,python]
------------------------------------
>>> from elastic_enterprise_search import EnterpriseSearch

# Connecting to an instance on Elastic Cloud w/ username and password
>>> ent_search = EnterpriseSearch(
    "https://<...>.ent-search.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io",
    http_auth=("elastic", "<password>"),
)
>>> ent_search.get_version()
{
  'number': '7.10.0',
  'build_hash': '9d6eb9f067b7d7090c541890c21f6a1e15f29c48',
  'build_date': '2020-10-05T16:19:16Z'
}

# If you're only planning on using App Search you
# can instantiate App Search namespaced client by itself:
>>> from elastic_enterprise_search import AppSearch

# Connecting to an instance on Elastic Cloud w/ an App Search private key
>>> app_search = AppSearch(
    "https://<...>.ent-search.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io",
    http_auth="private-<private key>",
)
>>> app_search.index_documents(
    engine_name="national-parks",
    body=[{
        "id": "yellowstone",
        "title": "Yellowstone National Park"
    }]
)
------------------------------------

[NOTE]
All the API calls map the raw REST API as closely as possible, including
the distinction between required and optional arguments to the calls. This
means that the code makes distinction between positional and keyword arguments;
**we recommend that people use keyword arguments for all calls for
consistency and safety.**

==== Using Python datetimes with timezones

Python https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime[`datetime.datetime`]
objects are automatically serialized according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339[RFC 3339]
which requires a timezone to be included. We highly recommend using datetimes that
are timezone-aware. When creating a datetime object, use the `tzinfo` or `tz` parameter
along with https://dateutil.readthedocs.io[`python-dateutil`] to ensure proper
timezones on serialized `datetime` objects.

To get the current day and time in UTC you can do the following:

[source,python]
------------------------------------
import datetime
from dateutil import tz

now = datetime.datetime.now(tz=tz.UTC)
------------------------------------

⚠️ **Datetimes without timezone information will be serialized as if they were within
the locally configured timezone.** This is in line with HTTP and RFC 3339 specs
which state that datetimes without timezone information should be assumed to be local time.

⚠️ https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2019/11/utcnow.html[**Do not use `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` or `utcfromtimestamp()`!**]
These APIs don't add timezone information to the resulting datetime which causes the
serializer to return incorrect results.
