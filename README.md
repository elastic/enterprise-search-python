Official Python client for Elastic Enterprise Search, App Search, and Workplace Search

## Installation

The package can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
$ python -m pip install elastic-enterprise-search
```

The version follows the Elastic Stack version so `7.10` is compatible
with Enterprise Search released in Elastic Stack 7.10.

> **NOTE: The package `elastic-enterprise-search` was previously used as a client for
> only 'Elastic Workplace Search' before the product was renamed. When installing
> make sure you receive a version greater than 7.10.0.**
